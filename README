The msgeq7_test file was used to learn and test the following:

* How to set up a timer correctly
* How to set up the ADC correctly
* How to read the output of the MSGEQ7

The makefile assumes that you are using the STK500 development board, an ATmega644 microcontroller and that you are
using avrdude to do the programming.
